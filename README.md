# Weaponised XSS Payloads
_XSS payloads designed to turn alert(1) into P1._

In this repository you will find a bunch of JavaScript files which can be loaded into an XSS payload in order to perform sensitive functions on popular CMS platforms in the context of the victim's browser. This can help to chain a plain old XSS bug into something more critical, like an account takeover.

This is perfect for beefing up the severity of a pentest or bug bounty report by demonstrating real security impact.

Pull requests are welcome.
